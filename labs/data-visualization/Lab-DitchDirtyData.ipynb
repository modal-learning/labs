    "\n",
    "SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. It's a programming language that lets us store and retrieve important business data stored in _relational databases_. In the most basic terms, you can think of a relational database as a set of spreadsheets linked together. In SQL, we call these spreadsheets **tables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with spreadsheets before, SQL tables will look quite familiar. Tables are comprised rows and columns. Each row is called a **record**, and each column represents an **attribute** of that record.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example dataset, each row represents a newly posted job listing on monster.com. The columns simply tell us more about that job. Each job might have attributes like `job_title`, `location`, or `salary`:\n",
