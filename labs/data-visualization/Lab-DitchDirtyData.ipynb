    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a programming language that lets us store and retrieve important business data stored in _relational databases_. In the most basic terms, you can think of a relational database as a set of spreadsheets linked together. In SQL, we call these spreadsheets **tables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with spreadsheets before, SQL tables will look quite familiar. Tables are comprised rows and columns. Each row is called a **record**, and each column represents an **attribute** of that record.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example dataset, each row represents a newly posted job listing on monster.com. The columns simply tell us more about that job by describing its attributes like `job_title`, `location`, or `salary`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: INSERT AN ILLUSTRATION**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to our Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in working with SQL is connecting to our database. To get warmed up, try running the following command to create a new connection to our `jobs` database.\n",
